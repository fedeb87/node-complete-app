This is a complete Node.js application. Where I follow the step to step from [Get Programming with Node.js](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-node-js). The main goal for this repo are expose several features that Node offer, and that we can implement it in a few lines of code. It include: CRUD operations, live chat, auth and user login, REST Api development and and communication with MongoDB. 

## Before you start
This project include seeds file for populate the database at first time. 
Tools that I used for the project:

 1. Node.js v16.17.0
 2. MongoDB v5.0.9
 3. Mocha 10.0.0 for run test.

 Also I include some files to deploy the app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 

## Screenshots
The screenshot below shows how the app looks like when it is done.

### Libraries and Technologies

 - Application entirely written in JavaScript.
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/es/) for web application infrastructure.
 - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for pesistant storage.
 - [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) for login and users authentication.
 - [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing.
 - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for web sockets implementation, to emulate the real-time comunication in a chat-room

## Notes
The main goal of this application is learn Node and several of his components, hence the front-end doesn't look so polished ;)
